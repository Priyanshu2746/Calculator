README

This Java program provides basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division for two numbers as well as an array of numbers. It also calculates the sum, mean, standard deviation, and variance of an array of numbers.

The program prompts the user to choose whether to work on two numbers or an array of numbers. For two numbers, the user is prompted to choose which operation to perform. For an array of numbers, the user is prompted to enter the size of the array and then select which operation to perform.

To run the program, execute the Main class. The program will prompt the user for input and display the result of the operation. The program will continue to prompt the user for input until the user chooses to close the calculator.
